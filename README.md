Recreation of the Windows 10 Technical Preview/Windows RT Update 3's DirectUI based start menu.

Supported operating systems:
- Windows 8.1 build 6.3.9600
- All Windows 10 builds
- Windows 11 (With ExplorerPatcher)

Might be supported in the future:
- Windows 7
- Windows 8

The tile layout is based around an user editable xml, which is stored in your User folder, in the DirectStart folder.
Documentation for various settings coming soon.

Notes: 
- If you are building the application manually, you need to put the contents of the "ConfigurationTemplate" folder in the repository into your user folder.
- To "pin" items to the start menu, please put them in the "C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu"
